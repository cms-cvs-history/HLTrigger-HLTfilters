hlt = Executable python script that creates a trigger table in memory,
writes a config file with prescale definitions, and then executes
cmsRun to run the HLTs. At the moment, the cmsRun part is commented out.

If you execute 'hlt' you should see the same output as in hlt.stdout and
file 'triggers.cfi' will be created and should be identifical to 
triggers.cfi.ref.

If you get 'CMSSW_SEARCH_PATH is not defined.' that is because you have
not definied a runtime release with scramv1.

This is a work in progress. Comments are welcome.
